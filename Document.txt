# Assumption to start

- The dictfile is the file used as key for searching word inside inputs files.
- The program will no execute if no dictfile in not provided
- The wordcount program parses the dicfile to build the list of key word to search
- The input stream files are made by the input provided from command line or from standard input
  - The input stream aare consider as file present in the currect directory
- The total number of word is the sum of all word from input files concatenated


# Description of the implementation
The program will first get the inputs, consolidate the inpiuts then execute the count, and final provide the output and clean the workspace.
- Inputs can come from command line or standard intput. 
  The function func_vidrequestinputfiles() will manages the standard inputs
  The function func_vidbuildinputstream() will manage command line inputs
  The function func_vidParseDictfile() will parse the dicftfile 
-

# Usage
the wordcout is compilated as follow:
gcc wordcound.c -o wordcound
